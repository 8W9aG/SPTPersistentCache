Everyone tries to implement a cache at some point in their app‚Äôs lifecycle, and this is ours. This is a library that allows people to cache `NSData` with time to live (TTL) values and semantics for disk management.

- [x] üì± iOS 7.0+
- [x] üíª OS X 10.9+

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:
`SPTPersistentCache` is designed as an LRU cache which stores all the data in a single binary file, with entries containing the length, last accessed time and a CRC check designed to prevent corruption. It can be used to automatically schedule garbage collection and invoke pruning.

## Installation
`SPTPersistentCache` can be installed in a variety of ways including traditional static libraries and dynamic frameworks.

### Static Library
Simply include `SPTPersistentCache.xcodeproj` in your App‚Äôs Xcode project, and link your app with the library in the ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù section.

### CocoaPods
We are indexed on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), which can be installed using [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/):
```shell
$ gem install cocoapods
```
Then simply add `SPTPersistentCache` to your `Podfile`.
```
pod 'SPTPersistentCache', '~> 1.0'
```
Lastly let CocoaPods do it's thing by running:
```shell
$ cocoapods update
```

### Carthage
We support [Carthage](https://github.con/Carthage/Carthage) and provide pre-built binary frameworks for all new releases. Start by making sure you have the latest version of Carthage installed, e.g. using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
You will also need to add `SPTPersistentCache` to your `Cartfile`:
```
github 'spotify/SPTPersistentCache' ~> 1.0
```
After that is all said and done, let Carthage pull in SPTPersistentCache like so:
```shell
$ carthage update
```
Next up, you need to add the framework to the Xcode project of your App. Lastly link the framework with your App and copy it to the App‚Äôs Frameworks directory under the ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù.

## Background story :book:
At Spotify we began to standardise the way we handled images in a centralised way, and in doing so we initially created a component that was handling images and their caching. But then our requirements changed, and we began to need caching for our backend calls and preview MP3 downloads as well. In doing so, we managed to separate out our caching logic into a generic component that can be used for any piece of data.

Thus we boiled down what we needed in a cache, the key features being TTL on specific pieces of data, disk management to make sure we don't use too much, and protections against data corruption. It also became very useful to separate different caches into separate files (such as images and mp3s), in order to easily measure how much space each item is taking up.
